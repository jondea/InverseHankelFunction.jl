# Inverse Hankel function branches

To understand the branches in the inverse of the Hankel function, we look at the
behaviour of several Hankel functions near the origin.
The white contours are constant argument, and the black lines are constant magnitude.
We can tell that there are multiple branches in all of these cases.
For example, in the first plot, following a line of constant magnitude in the
upper half, we can see multiple points with the same argument.
These points are multiple solutions (`z`) for a particular value of the the
Hankel function (`h`).

As we increase the order of the Hankel function (which we will denote by `m`),
we see the small argument (`zâ‰ˆ0`) [asymptotics](asymptotics) become clearer,
with a zero of multiplicity equal to `m`.
Therefore around `z=0` we see that there will be at least `m` branches of the
inverse of the Hankel function.
This motivates us to start our enumeration of our branches here, indexed by `b`
